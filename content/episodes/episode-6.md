Join Art Director [Jesse Taylor](/#jesse-taylor) as he walks us through Bannersnack, the online tool which makes building digital banners ads a breeze. We will explore how to create multiple size web banners, easily editable text and colors and animations in a fraction of the time it takes other programs. Actual snacks optional but encouraged. Intro by emcee [Callie Watson](#/callie-watson).
