The [DAVE School](https://www.facebook.com/DAVESchool/) and AIGA Tallahassee are excited to present a one-of-a-kind film viewing experience. Come virtually attend a drive-in theater like no other as we hop into VR–on the desktop–for some spooky creature feature action. Short Intro by [Jon Gress](/#jon-gress). Visit the [Design Week Tallahassee Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/designweektally) for more info.
