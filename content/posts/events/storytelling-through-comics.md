DWT ventures to the UK for its first international talk. Joining us is cartoonist and writer, [Ramya Sriram](/#ramya-sriram), the creator of The Tap comics. Ramya will go through how to create stories through simple, minimalistic comics: generating ideas, writing the script, and creating effective illustrations. She will also be demonstrating drawing techniques and exercises to show how simple lines and strokes can be used to convey emotions and expressions powerfully.
