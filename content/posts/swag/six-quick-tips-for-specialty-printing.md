Hey there! It is an honor for FRESH IMPRESSION LETTERPRESS STUDIO to sponsor an event such as Design Week Tallahass. We Know that Covid-19 has changed all the amazing plans that were made, but I personally couln't be happier to see everyone adapting to the situation and continuing to move forward. The show must go on! As they say...  

In light of these changes, we were given an opportunity to put together 6 quick tips for specialty printing, just for you. Let's hope you find the useful, and they help you conquer a few creatures of habit!
